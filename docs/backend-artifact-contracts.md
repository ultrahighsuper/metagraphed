# Metagraphed Backend Artifact Contracts

Metagraphed v1 is backend-first. The public contract is static JSON under `https://api.metagraph.sh/metagraph/*`; UI work can consume these artifacts later without changing the registry pipeline.

## Contract Rules

- `registry/native/finney-subnets.json` is canonical for active Finney subnet existence.
- `registry/subnets/**/*.json` is canonical for curated public interface metadata.
- `registry/candidates/**/*.json` is discovery-only. Candidates are not verified registry surfaces until promotion.
- `registry/adapters/latest/*.json` stores safe adapter snapshots for subnet-specific public metrics.
- `registry/reviews/maintainer-reviewed.json` stores public-safe maintainer review decisions.
- `schemas/components/*.schema.json` is canonical for public API/artifact component schemas.
- `schemas/api-components.schema.json` is a generated bundle and should not be edited by hand.
- `/metagraph/openapi.json`, `/metagraph/types.d.ts`, `generated/metagraphed-api.d.ts`, and `generated/metagraphed-client.ts` are generated from the canonical schema and route metadata.
- `public/metagraph/*` files are compact generated projections and should not be edited by hand. R2-only artifacts must not be committed there.
- `dist/metagraph-r2/metagraph/*` is the ignored staging tree for volatile/detail generated projections that are uploaded to R2.
- Artifact contracts carry `storage_tier`: `dual` for compact Git-plus-R2 artifacts, `r2` for volatile/detail artifacts, and `git` for local-only generated support artifacts.
- Health, RPC, adapter, and schema-drift artifacts are operational observations, not protocol authority.
- No secrets, wallet data, PATs, private dashboards, or validator-sensitive flows belong in any public artifact.
- Zod is not backend contract authority in v1. Zod helpers can be generated later for frontend consumers, but JSON Schema plus AJV remains canonical.

## Backend Commands

- `npm run build`: regenerate deterministic public artifacts from current registry inputs.
- `npm run validate`: validate native snapshot, overlays, candidates, review decisions, generated artifacts, and required schemas.
- `npm run sync:subnets`: update the native Finney snapshot.
- `npm run discover:candidates`: refresh public-source candidate discovery from chain-adjacent enrichment sources, third-party subnet dashboards, subnet metagraph explorer pages, GitHub README links, and public project websites. GitHub README-derived links are capped, de-duplicated by kind/domain, and limited to project-affiliated provenance before they enter the generated candidate bundle.
- `npm run verify:candidates`: safely verify public candidates.
- `npm run curate:baseline`: derive generated overlays from verified candidates, commit only compact checksum metadata, and stage expanded generated overlays outside Git for R2.
- `npm run review:promote`: apply public-safe maintainer review decisions to overlays.
- `npm run schemas:snapshot`: fetch machine-readable OpenAPI/Swagger JSON snapshots and update schema drift.
- `npm run schemas:bundle`: bundle canonical modular JSON Schema components into `schemas/api-components.schema.json`.
- `npm run adapters:snapshot`: capture safe Allways/Gittensor public adapter summaries.
- `METAGRAPH_WRITE_PROBE_RESULTS=1 npm run probes:smoke`: run live read-only probes and persist health/RPC history.
- `npm run r2:manifest`: regenerate the Cloudflare R2 manifest from current public artifacts.
- `npm run r2:download:dry-run`: summarize an R2 restore/download without writing local files.
- `npm run kv:publish:dry-run`: summarize KV latest pointer, feature flags, endpoint pool, and freshness control records.
- `npm run validate:schemas`: run strict JSON Schema validation over registry inputs and public artifacts.
- `npm run validate:api`: validate Worker API routes over local artifacts.

- `npm run validate:schema-enums`: validate enum parity between canonical schemas and route/query validation.
- `npm run validate:openapi-examples`: validate real artifact-backed response examples against OpenAPI.
- `npm run validate:generated-client`: validate the generated TypeScript client helper is current.
- `npm run contract:summary`: compare schema contracts against a base ref and classify changes as additive, risky, or breaking.
- `npm run validate:docs`: validate public docs against current artifact and API contracts.
- `npm run validate:intake`: validate GitHub issue intake templates.
- `npm run candidate:new`: generate a one-candidate community PR file.
- `npm run provider:new`: generate a one-provider-profile community PR file.
- `npm run submission:comment`: render a deterministic Markdown submission report.
- `npm run validate:workflows`: validate workflow hardening rules.
- `npm run worker:deploy:dry-run`: validate Worker/Wrangler deployment shape without contacting Cloudflare.
- `npm run sync:summary`: generate a registry-refresh PR summary from actual artifact diffs.

Local generated artifacts default to the deterministic review timestamp. Use
`METAGRAPH_BUILD_TIMESTAMP=<iso-8601>` only when a refresh needs an explicit
shared `generated_at` across discovery, build, schema, and R2 manifest
artifacts.

Production publish validation can enforce operational freshness with:

```bash
METAGRAPH_REQUIRE_PROBE_HEALTH=1 METAGRAPH_REQUIRE_FRESHNESS=1 npm run validate
```

Those gates require fresh native subnet data, candidate discovery, candidate
verification, probe-derived health, and adapter snapshots. Schema drift remains
warning-only until more subnets expose machine-readable schemas.

## Cloudflare Runtime

`workers/api.mjs` serves stable `/api/v1/*` JSON envelopes over the canonical artifact tree. It reads from Workers Static Assets first and can fall back to R2 through `METAGRAPH_ARCHIVE` when configured. If the optional `METAGRAPH_CONTROL` KV binding exists, the Worker reads `metagraph:latest` to resolve the current R2 prefix.

The RPC proxy route is intentionally disabled unless `METAGRAPH_ENABLE_RPC_PROXY=true`. When enabled for controlled testing, it only accepts single JSON-RPC POST bodies and blocks write/unsafe methods before any upstream request is made.

## Change-Feed Webhooks + SSE

metagraph.sh regenerates its dataset on a ~6h schedule (ADR 0001), so the realtime surface is a **change feed**: a notification within seconds of each publish, not a sub-second tail. These routes live outside the artifact contract (dynamic, KV-backed) and degrade to `503 webhooks_unavailable` when the `METAGRAPH_CONTROL` KV binding is absent.

- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/subscriptions` — register `{ url, filters?: { netuids?: integer[], kinds?: ("subnets"|"artifacts")[] }, secret? }`. The `url` must be a public `https://` endpoint (private/loopback/link-local hosts and non-default ports are rejected). Returns `{ id, secret, ... }` once; the secret is never echoed again.
- `GET /api/v1/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}` — fetch a subscription's public view (no secret).
- `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}` — delete; requires the secret in the `x-metagraph-webhook-secret` header.
- `GET /api/v1/events` — thin SSE change feed: emits the current change snapshot (derived from `changelog.json` + the KV `latest` pointer) as one `event: snapshot`, with `retry: 300000` advising a 5-minute reconnect. There is no value in holding a connection across the 6h cadence.

At publish time the dispatcher reads `changelog.json`, matches each subscription's filters, and `POST`s the change event signed with `HMAC-SHA256` (hex) over the raw body in the `x-metagraph-signature` header. Subscriptions auto-expire after 180 days of inactivity. The SSRF guard is best-effort and cannot prevent DNS rebinding; the dispatcher runs on GitHub-hosted runners with no access to the project's network, which bounds the residual risk.

## Remote MCP Server (AI agents)

`POST /mcp` is a stateless [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server (Streamable HTTP transport, JSON-RPC 2.0) that exposes the registry to AI agents (Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, autonomous agents). It is read-only, so there is no session id, Durable Object, or server-initiated stream; `GET /mcp` returns `405`. The handler (`src/mcp-server.mjs`) is dispatched before the read-only method gate (it is POST-only, like the RPC proxy) and reuses the exact R2/ASSETS artifact resolution via injected readers, so MCP tools and REST routes always agree.

Tools (thin wrappers over the artifact contract): `search_subnets`, `find_subnets_by_capability`, `get_subnet`, `get_subnet_health`, `list_subnet_apis`, `get_api_schema`, `get_agent_catalog`, `get_best_rpc_endpoint` (live-health-filtered), and `registry_summary`. `tools/call` returns the MCP result envelope (`content[]` text + `structuredContent`); argument and artifact failures degrade to an `isError: true` result rather than a transport error. The server is validated by `npm run validate:mcp` (lifecycle + one `tools/call` per tool against a cold local env) and smoke-checked live by `scripts/smoke-live-api.mjs`. The endpoint is excluded from the `validate-api` route-count invariant and is added to `assets.run_worker_first`.

## AI Search + Ask (semantic + RAG)

Two **out-of-contract dynamic routes** (special-handled like `/api/v1/events`, so they are not in `API_ROUTES`, OpenAPI, or the `validate-api` route-count invariant) power natural-language discovery, backed by Workers AI + a Vectorize index:

- `GET /api/v1/search/semantic?q=&limit=` — embeds the query (`@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5`, 768-dim) and returns the nearest registry entries `{ score, type, netuid, slug, title, subtitle, url }` (limit ≤ 20). Vector search, so it matches intent without exact keywords.
- `POST /api/v1/ask` — body `{ question }`. Retrieves the top-6 registry entries and prompts `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` with a cite-only system prompt, returning `{ question, answer, citations[], context_count, model }`. The answer is grounded in registry context and cites sources as `[n]`.

Both live in `src/ai-search.mjs`, return the standard `{ ok, schema_version, data, meta }` envelope, and are gated three ways: the `METAGRAPH_ENABLE_AI` kill-switch, the presence of the `AI` + `VECTORIZE` bindings (absent in local/CI → `503 ai_unavailable`), and the `AI_RATE_LIMITER` binding (20 req/60s per client IP; absent → allow). Hard caps bound cost: result/context size and a 1000-char question limit. The Vectorize index is kept warm by a daily embedding-sync cron (`37 3 * * *`) that diffs the `search.json` index against a content-hash manifest in KV and re-embeds only the deltas. Response shapes are validated by `npm run validate:ai` (disabled→503, stubbed-enabled→200 against `schemas/ai/*.schema.json`, negatives + rate-limit); see ADR 0003.

## Current Domain Scope

Use `metagraph.sh` for the current launch. Do not use `subnet.health` for v1 registry, status, badge, health, or probe contracts.
