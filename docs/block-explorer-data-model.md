# Block Explorer Data Model

This is the reference for "what does a block actually contain, what does a full archive
node expose, and what does a real Bittensor block explorer need to show" — researched and
verified 2026-07-08 (source-level, against live polkadot-sdk, plus a direct competitor
audit of taostats.io and taomarketcap.com). Read this before re-researching any of it.

## Blocks, extrinsics, and events

A Substrate block has a header (block number, parent hash, `state_root`, `extrinsics_root`,
`digest`) and a body: an ordered list of **extrinsics**.

**Extrinsics are the input.** Substrate's general term for "things included and executed in
a block" — broader than "transaction": it covers user-signed calls (`SubtensorModule.set_weights`)
and **inherents**, special extrinsics the block author inserts itself, not signed by any user
(every block's extrinsic #0 is `Timestamp.set`).

**Events are the output** — the log of what happened as a _result_ of executing extrinsics.
One extrinsic can produce zero, one, or many events. Every extrinsic ends in exactly one
`System.ExtrinsicSuccess` or `System.ExtrinsicFailed` event (source of the `success` column
on `extrinsics`).

The `phase` field ties them together. Verified directly against block #8,575,300: events
0–270 all had `phase=Initialization` — fired automatically at the _start_ of block execution,
before any extrinsic ran (emission distribution, scheduled weight-reveals — none triggered by
a user). Events 271+ had `phase=ApplyExtrinsic`, each tagged with the causing `extrinsic_index`.
Execution order for every block: **Initialization events → extrinsics execute in order, each
producing its own events → Finalization events (if any).** Replaying a block's extrinsics
against the prior block's state deterministically produces both the new state and this log —
that determinism is what consensus is built on.

## The gap: extrinsics + events give you a log, not a snapshot

Events are a log of _changes_, not a snapshot of _current values_. A `Balances.Transfer` event
tells you money moved; it doesn't hand you "this account's balance right now." Point-in-time
values (an account's exact balance, a hotkey's stake, a neuron's weight vector) at a specific
historical block require querying **state/storage**, not replaying events.

This is what "archive node" means, distinct from an events indexer: the archive node retains
the full state trie at every historical block. Verified from live polkadot-sdk source
(`substrate/client/db/src/lib.rs`, `substrate/client/cli/src/params/pruning_params.rs`):
pruning has **two independent axes**.

- `--state-pruning` (`PruningMode::{ArchiveAll, ArchiveCanonical, Constrained(n)}`, default
  keeps only the last 256 blocks' state) — governs the **state trie**.
- `--blocks-pruning` (`BlocksPruning::{KeepAll, KeepFinalized, Some(n)}`, default
  `archive-canonical`) — governs **block bodies and justifications**.

A node can retain full block/extrinsic/event history forever (`blocks-pruning=archive`) while
still discarding all state older than 256 blocks (`state-pruning=256`, the default) — it'll
happily serve `chain_getBlock`/events back to genesis, but any `state_getStorage` call at an
old block fails with a pruned-state error. **Only `state-pruning=archive` keeps the full
historical trie.** `--pruning archive` (the legacy single flag) is a clap alias for
`--state-pruning` ONLY — it does not set `--blocks-pruning`, which silently defaults to
`archive-canonical` if not passed explicitly. Both flags must be set explicitly for a true,
complete archive node.

## What a full archive node exposes beyond `chain_getBlock` + `system_events`

Verified against live polkadot-sdk source, 2026-07-08:

- **`state_getStorage`/`getStorageAt`/`getKeysPaged`/`getPairs`/`getReadProof`** — direct
  historical state reads at an arbitrary block. Requires `state-pruning=archive`.
- **`state_call`** (aliased `state_callAt`) — execute any Runtime API method against a
  historical block's state. This is how you get _computed_ values (e.g. a chain-defined
  aggregate like subnet/neuron info) rather than one raw storage key. Same archive-depth
  requirement as above. Parity's own guidance: prefer custom Runtime APIs + `state_call` over
  bespoke RPC endpoints — a Runtime API upgrades with the runtime, no node restart needed.
- **Header fields we don't currently store**: `state_root`, `extrinsics_root` (Merkle
  commitments), `digest` (Aura consensus logs — the slot number and the author's seal
  signature, letting you independently verify block authorship without re-executing it).
- **GRANDPA justifications** (`grandpa_proveFinality`) — finality proofs, but **sparsely
  stored even on a full archive node**: only at authority-set-change blocks, every
  `justification_period` blocks, and the current finalized tip. `grandpa_proveFinality`
  reconstructs a proof for any block by walking to the nearest stored one. Retention is also
  gated by `--blocks-pruning archive`.
- **`archive_v1_*`** — a JSON-RPC v2 surface **stabilized June 2026** (`polkadot-sdk` release
  `stable2506`), purpose-built for archivers/indexers, intended to eventually replace the ad
  hoc `state_*`/`chain_*` combination: `genesisHash`, `hashByHeight` (correctly handles
  forks — multiple hashes per height, unlike `chain_getBlockHash`'s one-hash assumption),
  `header`, `body`, `finalizedHeight`, `call` (the `state_call` equivalent), and `storage`/
  `storageDiff` as **streaming subscriptions** designed for bulk indexer reads rather than
  one-off blocking calls. Build future state-ingestion against this, not the older methods.

## What a real Bittensor block explorer needs (benchmarked against taostats.io and taomarketcap.com)

taostats.io is the dominant, most feature-complete explorer. TaoMarketCap is the strongest
"second" — notably has a "Conviction" tab (subnet-owner exit-lock vesting tracker) taostats
lacks, a real differentiator worth matching or beating.

**Block/extrinsic/event pages** — foundation we already have, verified accurate:

- Block page: header + Extrinsics tab + Events tab (taostats hides the first ~30 System
  events by default — worth copying).
- Extrinsic detail page: decoded call name/params, signer, fee, linked events — a full
  decoder. We already store `call_args` as JSONB, so the raw material exists.
- Site-wide `/blocks`, `/extrinsics`, `/events`, `/runtime` (spec-version change history),
  `/sudo` (root-origin calls) tables.

**Account pages**: balance breakdown (staked-to-root / staked-in-alpha / free / liquidity-pool
/ reserved), alpha holdings per subnet/validator, transfer + stake-transaction history. The
history is event-log-derived (buildable from what we have now). **The current balance
breakdown is a state snapshot, not derivable from events alone.**

**Subnet pages**: identity, market data (price/mcap/volume — needs a price/DEX data source we
don't have), and **hyperparameters** (rho, kappa, tempo, immunity period, commit-reveal
settings, etc.) — live state values, not events.

**The metagraph** (per-neuron: UID, stake weight, VTrust, consensus, incentive, dividends,
emission, "Updated" = blocks since last weight-set) — **fundamentally a state snapshot**.
Already captured today via a separate D1-backed pipeline (`.github/workflows/refresh-metagraph.yml`
→ `scripts/fetch-metagraph-native.py` → D1 `neurons`) — see the block-explorer completion
roadmap issue tree for the one confirmed remaining gap (subnet hyperparameters).

**Validator dashboards, historical time-series** (price charts, registration-cost charts,
historical metagraph snapshots) — mix of event-derived and state-derived data.

## Our current data model vs. the gap

We capture the **log layer** — `blocks` (curated subset), `extrinsics`, `chain_events`,
`account_events` — via the indexer decoding live blocks + events. Verified accurate via
direct independent cross-check against two sources with zero shared infrastructure with our
indexing pipeline (our own archive node for a historical block, `entrypoint-finney.opentensor.ai`
for a live one): perfect parity, both extrinsic and event content, exact order.

Per-neuron metagraph state is already captured (see above) via D1, not Postgres — the
Postgres `neurons`/`neuron_daily`/`economics_history` tables exist in the schema as future
D1→Postgres cutover targets (ADR 0013) but have no writer yet; check D1's route list in
`workers/config.mjs` before assuming a chain-data tier is missing, the two can diverge.

The one confirmed, unfiled capture gap is **subnet hyperparameters** — no pipeline captures
these anywhere. Everything else needed for full explorer parity is a derived view or narrow
enrichment on already-accurate data, not new chain-state capture. See the block-explorer
completion roadmap issue tree for the full breakdown.

Price/market data is a separate problem again — not a state read in the simple sense, needs
a decision on data source (on-chain bonding-curve state vs. an external price feed).

## Governance/Sudo pallet audit (#4310/2.1, 2026-07-08)

The competitor benchmark (taostats.io) describes a generic Substrate governance shape
(20-member Proposer → 3-member Triumvirate 7-day vote → 16-32-voter Senate 48h 75%/51%
thresholds) — **subtensor does not have this.** Confirmed against live finney runtime metadata
(bittensor 10.5.0, `SubtensorApi(network="finney").substrate.metadata`):

```
ALL PALLETS: AdminUtils, AlphaAssets, Aura, Balances, BaseFee, Commitments, Contracts,
Crowdloan, Drand, EVM, EVMChainId, Ethereum, Grandpa, LimitOrders, MevShield, Multisig,
Preimage, Proxy, RandomnessCollectiveFlip, SafeMode, Scheduler, SubtensorModule, Sudo, Swap,
System, Timestamp, TransactionPayment, Utility
```

No `Council`, `Senate`, `SenateMembers`, `TechnicalCommittee`, `Triumvirate`, `Democracy`, or
`Referenda` pallet exists. Only two pallets carry the governance-adjacent surface:

- **`Sudo`** — calls: `sudo`, `sudo_as`, `sudo_unchecked_weight`, `set_key`, `remove_key`.
  Storage: `Key` (`Optional<AccountId>`, the current sudo holder — live value on 2026-07-08:
  `5DcSqBNqCmfdJZRGFSwwcRb2dZdJHZuKK8Tb1Gx8gbmF5E8s`). Events: `Sudid`, `KeyChanged`,
  `KeyRemoved`, `SudoAsDone`.
- **`AdminUtils`** — subtensor's own root-origin admin-config pallet, ~83 calls (almost all
  `sudo_set_*`, e.g. `sudo_set_kappa`, `sudo_set_tempo`, `sudo_set_immunity_period`,
  `sudo_set_min_burn`/`sudo_set_max_burn`, `sudo_set_commit_reveal_weights_enabled`,
  `sudo_set_liquid_alpha_enabled`, `sudo_set_bonds_moving_average` — the same fields
  `subnet_hyperparams`, #4303, captures). Only 6 of the 83 calls emit a dedicated `AdminUtils`
  event (`PrecompileUpdated`, `Yuma3EnableToggled`, `BondsResetToggled`, `BurnHalfLifeSet`,
  `BurnIncreaseMultSet`, `SubnetEmissionEnabledSet`) — the reliable source for the rest is the
  extrinsic itself (`call_module = 'AdminUtils'`, decoded `call_args`).

Both `call_module` values are confirmed present in the captured `extrinsics` D1 tier: `Sudo`
had zero calls in the last ~104k blocks (~2 weeks) sampled 2026-07-08; `AdminUtils` had 57 in
the same window — this is where real activity happens. Epic #4310's 2.2 (`/api/v1/sudo`) and
2.3 (AdminUtils config-change feed, re-scoped from the original Council/Senate framing) and 2.4
(current Sudo key, re-scoped from Senate/Council membership) are built directly on this audit.

## Nested-call decode depth (#4319/4.1, 2026-07-09)

Question: does `call_args` already contain the fully-decoded inner calls of a
`Utility.batch`/`batch_all`/`force_batch` extrinsic, or just call indices that would need a
follow-up decode step? **Confirmed: `call_args` already contains the fully-decoded nested
calls.** 4.2 (nested-call rendering), 4.3 (Multisig), and 4.4 (Proxy) are pure rendering —
no backend decode addition needed.

Verified live against `GET /api/v1/extrinsics?call_module=Utility&call_function=<batch|
batch_all|force_batch>&limit=1` for all three call functions. Example (`batch_all`, block
8,581,077, extrinsic 18):

```json
"call_args": [{
  "name": "calls",
  "type": "Vec<RuntimeCall>",
  "value": [{
    "call_index": "0x0759",
    "call_function": "remove_stake_limit",
    "call_module": "SubtensorModule",
    "call_args": [
      { "name": "hotkey", "type": "AccountId", "value": "5E4z3h9y...ULde" },
      { "name": "netuid", "type": "NetUid", "value": 99 },
      { "name": "amount_unstaked", "type": "AlphaBalance", "value": 200000000000 },
      { "name": "limit_price", "type": "TaoBalance", "value": 14517744 },
      { "name": "allow_partial", "type": "bool", "value": false }
    ],
    "call_hash": "0xf500a2ad...cf7054c"
  }]
}]
```

`batch` and `force_batch` samples (including multi-call batches) confirm the identical shape:
each inner call carries `call_module`, `call_function`, a fully-expanded `call_args` list, and
its own `call_hash` — everything a renderer needs per inner call with zero extra decoding.

This repo does no recursive decode of its own — `scripts/fetch-events.py`'s `_extrinsic_call`
(`call.get("call_args")` → `_safe_json`) and `src/extrinsics.mjs`'s `formatExtrinsic`
(`JSON.parse(row.call_args)`) are both flat pass-throughs. The nesting is already present in
`substrate-interface`'s decoded `Call`-type SCALE output (pinned `==1.8.1`,
`.github/workflows/backfill-events.yml`) before this repo ever sees it — the recursion happens
inside the library's decoder, not in application code. The same `Call`-typed decode applies to
any nested-call argument (Multisig's `call`/`call_hash`, Proxy's `real`/`call`), so 4.3/4.4
should see the identical fully-decoded shape.

One caveat for 4.2: per-inner-call **success** is not part of `call_args` — it comes from
`Utility.ItemCompleted`/`BatchInterrupted` events and needs correlating separately by
`extrinsic_index` (`account_events`/`chain_events`, same join `_extrinsic_success_map` already
does for the outer extrinsic). No schema change is needed either way — `migrations/0015_
extrinsic_call_args.sql`'s `call_args TEXT` column already holds this shape as-is.

## Governance/Sudo pallet audit continued: registration-burn pallet audit (#4339/8.4, 2026-07-09)

Question (#4343's own framing): is the per-registration TAO-recycled amount "derivable from
burn-on-registration extrinsics already in the log layer, not new RPC capture"? **No — that
premise doesn't hold.** Verified empirically against live finney (bittensor 10.4.0) at a real
`burned_register` extrinsic (block 8,582,122, extrinsic 14, netuid 101):

- The extrinsic's own `call_args` carries only `netuid` + `hotkey` — no amount.
- Its `fee_tao` (0.00213142) is the ordinary per-byte transaction fee, unrelated to the burn.
- `substrate.get_events(block_hash)` at that exact `extrinsic_idx` shows the burn actually posts
  as a plain `Balances::Withdraw` event (`amount: 2131420` rao — coincidentally close to the fee
  in this sample, not the same field) alongside `SubtensorModule::NeuronRegistered` and
  `SubtensorModule::RAORecycledForRegistrationSet`. **No `Balances`-pallet event of any kind is
  ingested by this codebase's `account_events` pipeline** (`INGESTED_EVENT_KINDS`,
  `src/account-events.mjs`, is SubtensorModule-only plus a hardcoded `Transfer` — confirmed by
  reading the full list) — so even the correct on-chain signal isn't currently captured.
- `subnet_hyperparams_history` (#4309) captures only `min_burn_tao`/`max_burn_tao` — the
  _bounds_ on the dynamic burn — never the live current cost at any given block.

So there is no existing capture this repo has today that reconstructs a per-registration burn
amount, contradicting the issue's stated approach. **What _is_ available, and simpler than any
log-layer join:** `SubtensorModule::RAORecycledForRegistration` is a plain on-chain
`StorageMap<NetUid, u64>` — the chain's own running total of rao recycled for registration on
that subnet, confirmed to equal exactly the `amount` in the same block's
`RAORecycledForRegistrationSet` event (154,463,660,642 rao = 154.463660642 TAO for netuid 101 at
that block). A single `state_getStorage` query returns it directly — the same live-RPC +
KV-cache shape this repo already uses for `/accounts/{ss58}/balance` and `/sudo/key`
(`src/account-balance.mjs`, `src/sudo-key.mjs`), not a new capture pipeline. Storage key =
`twox128("SubtensorModule") ++ twox128("RAORecycledForRegistration") ++ <netuid as u16,
little-endian, Identity hasher — no hash on the map key>`, confirmed via
`substrate.create_storage_key(...)` across netuid 0/1/4/101/65535. Shipped as
`GET /api/v1/subnets/{netuid}/recycled` (`src/subnet-recycled.mjs`) on this basis instead of the
issue's literal log-layer approach.
