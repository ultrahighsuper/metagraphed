// ChainFirehoseHub -- the realtime chain-event fanout (#4982, ADR 0015,
// docs/realtime-firehose.md). The first Durable Object in this codebase.
//
// One global instance (idFromName("global")) receives #4980's NOTIFY
// payloads from the #4981 box-side relay on an authenticated internal
// endpoint and fans each one out to connected clients over SSE and
// WebSocket. Reached only through workers/api.mjs's CHAIN_FIREHOSE_HUB
// binding -- a Durable Object is never internet-addressable on its own, so
// every auth check lives in workers/api.mjs (handleChainFirehoseIngest),
// not here.
//
// This module is split in two for testability: the functions below make
// every actual decision (topic filtering, payload validation, SSE framing)
// and are plain, pure, unit-tested code. The ChainFirehoseHub class at the
// bottom is thin runtime glue over the Durable Object / WebSocket
// hibernation APIs (state.acceptWebSocket, ReadableStream controllers,
// WebSocketPair) -- none of which this repo's plain-vitest harness can drive
// (no @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers / Miniflare here). Per #4982's own
// issue body ("note any coverage gap explicitly rather than skipping
// silently"), that glue is marked with an explicit /* v8 ignore */ block
// rather than pretending it's covered.
//
// GraphQL subscriptions (#4983) are a second WS "mode" on this SAME class --
// negotiated via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: graphql-transport-ws on the SAME
// /subscribe path the plain firehose WS uses, not a separate DO or a second
// event pipeline (matches #4983's own issue body: "a thin protocol adapter
// on top of the existing hub"). See handleSubscribe/webSocketMessage/
// webSocketClose's graphql-ws branches, and src/graphql.mjs's
// GRAPHQL_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTEXT_KEY for the other half of the wiring.

    // relay) for however long that takes. This timeout only bounds how
    // long broadcast() WAITS; it does not cancel AlerterHub's own
    // in-flight work, which continues independently.
