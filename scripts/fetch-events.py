"""Chain-direct event poller (#1346, epic #1345) — FIRST-PARTY, not Taostats.

Decodes SubtensorModule events from a recent window of FINALIZED finney blocks
via substrate-interface against PUBLIC RPC (no API key), normalizes the
entity-relevant ones to `account_events` rows, and writes JSON to
dist/account-events.json. The refresh-events workflow stages that to R2; the
Worker's loadStagedEvents bulk-loads it into D1 with INSERT OR IGNORE keyed
(block_number, event_index) — idempotent, so an overlapping window re-inserts
harmlessly.

Recent-window scan + cursor-driven gap recovery (ADR 0012): each run scans
`compute_from_block(cursor, head, window, max_lookback) .. head` — the overlap
window floor `head - EVENTS_WINDOW + 1` (always re-scanned; idempotent), extended
back to `cursor + 1` when the scheduler coalesced runs for longer than the window,
so the gap since the last staged block is recovered (bounded by
EVENTS_MAX_LOOKBACK). After a successful stage the workflow advances the cursor to
`events-cursor.json`.

SOURCE MATTERS — completeness depends on whether old blocks are still fetchable:
  - PUBLIC RPC (the $0 bootstrap): nodes prune state at ~300 blocks AND GitHub
    coalesces the */5 cron to ~1.5-4.5h, so gaps wider than the prune horizon are
    gone before a later run reaches them. EVENTS_MAX_LOOKBACK defaults to the prune
    horizon (no point scanning past it). This tier is best-effort and lossy by
    construction (measured: ~58% of the block range).
  - ARCHIVE node (ADR 0012 / #1349 — the durable target): retains every block, so
    pointing EVENTS_RPC_URL at it and raising EVENTS_MAX_LOOKBACK makes the cursor
    recovery COMPLETE — any coalescing gap is back-filled in full. The continuous
    indexer is the eventual low-latency end state.

Run:  uv run --with substrate-interface python scripts/fetch-events.py
Env:  EVENTS_RPC_URL        public finney WS endpoint (default below)
      EVENTS_WINDOW         overlap floor: min blocks back from the finalized
                            head, even with a fresh cursor (default 256)
      EVENTS_CURSOR         highest block already staged (from R2); blank/absent
                            on a cold start → fall back to the window floor
      ACCOUNT_EVENTS_JSON   events output path (default dist/account-events.json)
      EVENTS_CURSOR_OUT     next-cursor sidecar path (default dist/events-cursor.json)
      EVENTS_BATCH_BLOCKS   max blocks emitted in one staged batch (default EVENTS_WINDOW)
      BLOCKS_JSON           per-block sidecar path (default dist/blocks.json) — the
                            block-explorer hot window (#1345), staged + loaded into
                            D1 `blocks` the same way the events JSON is
      EXTRINSICS_JSON       per-extrinsic sidecar path (default dist/extrinsics.json)
                            — the block-explorer extrinsic slice (#1345), staged +
                            loaded into D1 `extrinsics` the same way

Block-explorer sidecar (#1345 first vertical slice): the same per-block loop also
emits a `blocks` record (header hash, parent hash, best-effort author, extrinsic
count, decoded event count, observed_at) to BLOCKS_JSON. The refresh-events
workflow stages that sidecar to R2; the Worker's loadStagedBlocks bulk-loads it
into D1 `blocks` with INSERT OR IGNORE keyed on block_number — idempotent like the
events load. The extras are best-effort: a per-block extras failure skips that
block's block-row (never a corrupt row, never crashes the poll); the event rows
for that block are unaffected.

Block-explorer extrinsic sidecar (#1345 second vertical slice): the same per-block
loop also decodes each block's extrinsics (extrinsics_for_block) into `extrinsics`
rows (index, best-effort hash/signer, decoded call module+function, success from
the System.ExtrinsicSuccess/ExtrinsicFailed events for this index) and writes them
to EXTRINSICS_JSON. Staged + loaded into D1 `extrinsics` via loadStagedExtrinsics
with INSERT OR IGNORE keyed on (block_number, extrinsic_index) — idempotent. Each
extrinsic is best-effort: a per-extrinsic decode failure skips THAT row only
(never a corrupt row, never crashes the poll); the block/event rows are unaffected.

Positional attribute order verified against live finney (2026-06-21); see
src/account-events.mjs INDEXED_EVENT_KINDS for the loaded set. Extractors are
defensive: a shape that doesn't match (e.g. after a runtime upgrade) yields a
skipped event, never a corrupt row.
